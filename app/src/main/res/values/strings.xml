    <string name="aboutContent">2048 is played on a gray 4x4 grid, with numbered
    tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys.
    Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a
    value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until
    they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of
    the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the
    two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the
    same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow. The game is won when a tile with a value of
    2014 appears on the board, hence the name of the game. After reaching the 2048 tile,
    players can continue to play (beyond the 2048 tile) to reach higher score. The maximum
    possible tile is 131,072</string>
